Hello world! Let's create some poetry with bridge words.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Poetry is an art form, and it requires creativity.
How do we build bridges between words in the middle of a sentence?
The poet carefully selected words to form an elegant line.
Make sure to test for punctuation, special characters, and spaces!
